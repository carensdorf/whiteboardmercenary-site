According to public data, Amazon hired over 70,000 tech employees in 2021 alone during its peak growth period. This scale is staggering. But what's even more remarkable is that the quality of those hires hasn't diluted with volume."

It's a specific, actionable standard: a new hire must be better than 50% of all other Amazonians in the same job family and level across the company. This concept is embedded in the structure of every loop, and enforced through a role called the Bar Raiser. A Bar Raiser is an experienced interviewer responsible for maintaining hiring quality and consistency across teams."
